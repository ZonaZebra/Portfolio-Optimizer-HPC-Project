I want you to create a backend API Server will be using Node.js, Express.js, and Typescript. 

The API Server will responsible for handling the requests from the frontend and the backend Python HPC Server.
Currently the backend HPC server has one endpoint /optimize_portfolio which will return the optimized portfolio.
However, we will need to need to get the data to feed the Python HPC Server. 
The data will be getting will be from ALPHA Vantage API, it will return a CSV file.
We will need to combine all the relevant CSV file strings into array that will feed into the Python HPC Server.
The array will have this format [{stock_ticker, csv_file_string},{stock_ticker, csv_file_string} ...]

Here is an example of a POST to optimize_portfolio:
```
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/optimize_portfolio" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"csv_data": {"AAPL": "Date,adjusted_close\n2021-01-01,128.50\n2021-01-02,129.75\n2021-01-03,131.00", "MSFT": "Date,adjusted_close\n2021-01-01,219.75\n2021-01-02,220.50\n2021-01-03,221.25"}, "start_date": "2021-01-01", "end_date": "2021-01-03"}'
```

Here is an example of a GET to Alpha Vantage:
https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED&symbol=AAPL&apikey={DXMJ7O7ITS7K3JFJ}&outputsize=full&datatype=csv

Will be using the GET to Alpha Vantage to get the CSV file string for each stock symbol.

Our POST to optimize_portfolio will include all of the following:
```
class PortfolioOptimizationRequest(BaseModel):
    csv_data: Dict[str, str]
    start_date: str
    end_date: str
    pop_size: int = 100
    num_generations: int = 100
    risk_free_rate: float = 0.02
```

However prior to executing this POST, we will execute a series of GET to Alpha Vantage to get the CSV file string for each stock symbol.
The list of Stock symbols will be provided by the frontend.
We will then make a GET request to our cache server to see if we have the CSV file string for each stock symbol.
If we do not have the CSV file string for each stock symbol, we will make a GET request to Alpha Vantage to get the CSV file string for each stock symbol.
We will then make a POST request to our cache server to store the CSV file string for each stock symbol.
We will then make a POST request to our backend HPC server to execute the POST to optimize_portfolio.

Can you give me a basic layout for this backend API Server?
